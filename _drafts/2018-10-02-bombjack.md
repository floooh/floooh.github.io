title: "Writing a Bomb Jack emulator"
---

I wrote a new Bomb Jack arcade machine emulator in the last week using the [chips headers](https://github.com/floooh/chips), and since there's
not a lot of information about the Bomb Jack hardware I thought it
would make sense to write a blog post about the process and what I found
interesting.

## Why Bomb Jack

Easy: it's one of my favourite arcade machines, and I had the required
'software parts' ready :) The Bomb Jack arcade machine only requires
2 types of integrated circuit: the Z80 as CPU, and the AY-3-8910
as sound chip. My other favourite arcade machine (Pengo) also
uses the Z80 CPU, but custom audio- and video-chips which I haven't
written emulators for yet.

So Bomb Jack it is!

There's not a lot of information about the Bomb Jack arcade hardware
around, I only found 2 'primary sources' and 1 'secondary source':

- the MAME source code, with useful comments:
    - [MAME driver source code](https://github.com/mamedev/mame/blob/master/src/mame/drivers/bombjack.cpp)
    - [video decoder source code](https://github.com/mamedev/mame/blob/master/src/mame/video/bombjack.cpp
    )
- the [hardware schematics](https://github.com/floooh/emu-info/blob/master/misc/bombjack-schematics.pdf)
- a project to build [Bomb Jack as FGPA](http://papilio.cc/index.php?n=Playground.BombJack)

Compared to the wealth of information available for 80's home computers, this is really not a lot, it's especially not quite as easy to digest :)

But all the required information is there, it's just a bit harder to extract
than usual. Reading the MAME source is enough to get started, and where MAME
was a bit too obscure or abstract, looking at the schematics to confirm
details gave enough clues to create a working emulation.
